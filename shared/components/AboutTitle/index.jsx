        In the tattoo business, being a good tattoo artist calls for a lot of
        skill and commitment to giving utterly the best kind of art which can
        rival others. The fact of the matter is, not everyone can become
        exceptional tattoo artists. The ones that have already made it in the
        business, such names as Carolina Mansur, Rob Goodkind, and Tim Derose,
        have that something that makes them each tick and become the best that
        they are. So donâ€™t let anyone fool you that desire alone is all that you
        need to get in the game. That said, what makes us stand out from the
        rest?
